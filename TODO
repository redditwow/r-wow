Shit we need to get done before the launch
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Finish the FlairLink images
 - Default
 - Quests
 - <other stuff>
Create some sort of image for topmenu
Fix the "T" on WorldofReddit logo (its cut off and a few px too high)
New icon for "users online"
RES is fucking up the top right of the header. Fuck you RES
Restore CSS based flair for people that are members of community websites



Shit we can do whenever to make it a much cooler user experience
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cakeday image (Murloc perhaps?)
Need to better organize our image directories
Trim down the sidebar to make it less bad (Andrew said he would =D)



Shit that is super important
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
We need everyones help to keep all of our CSS and images versioned.
We didn't just waste a whole lot of time doing this to let people
ruin it. May be a good idea to also backup our sidebar every once in
a while. Version control is FTW I, Robert, suggest that we have all
issues with the reddit stylesheets either posted on one of our github
repos and/or posted to the moderator mail. Preferrably a repo issue
tracker so we can resolve them easier. 



Shit we found out is impossible because of reddit
