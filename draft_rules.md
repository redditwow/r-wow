# Rules & Guidelines
Hail, traveller! Rest your weary feet around the fire, grab your favourite beverage (whether you're partial to a mug of [[Thunder Ale]](http://www.wowhead.com/item=2686/thunder-ale) or a simple glass of [[Ice Cold Milk]](http://www.wowhead.com/item=1179/ice-cold-milk)) and settle in. We operate a policy of [guidelines](https://i.imgur.com/dPNGH7h.jpg) rather than rules for the most part, but hope you understand--and agree--that some moderation is best (be it of drinks or communities). These are here to help out the moderation team and subscribers alike, but are not exhaustive and the final call always lies with the moderation team. We generally like to give people an opportunity to learn from their mistakes before banishing users to the Twisting Nether, usually following the below process:

1. For a first offence, the offending content is removed, and the user is warned, either as a comment reply or by PM by a moderator.
2. For a second offence, the user is temporarily banned from contributing to the subreddit (for a length of 24 hours to a week), and a PM is sent to the user explaining why,
3. For a third offence, the user is banned permanently. Ding, dong and you burned your bridges--no coming back now.

Please note that reddit's rules dictate that the creation of new accounts to circumvent subreddit bans may lead to a site-wide shadowban and is *not* recommended. They're usually very good at spotting accounts created for the sole purpose of evading bans, and when they miss, we're usually very good at reporting them.

## Reddit Rules & Reddiquette
We ask that you adhere by the "hard" [Rules of Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) and [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) at all times, to ensure /r/WoW remains a pleasant place for everyone to contribute.

## Community Rules

Violation of certain rules will result in an immediate ban. If you are found in violation of any of the below, there will be no recourse, no discussion, and no ban suspensions. Most of our rules are in place to nurture genuine conversation and allow creativity to blossom by avoiding large amounts of low-effort and re-posted content to fill up the community.

#### Hate Speech
Comments or Posts that include hate-based words. The types of hate that we will ban include, but are not limited to, prejudice based on colour, sex or gender, religion, sexual orientation, country of origin or ability.

#### Porn/Rule34
World of Warcraft is rated T for Teen, and content on this community should be in line with this. There are better outlets for adult-themed World of Warcraft content.

##### Other Rules

###### Buying or Selling
/r/WoW is not an appropriate venue to sell items or services, whether in-game or physical. These are better fit for /r/WoWMarket, but please note that the sale of Battle.net accounts is a breach of Terms of Service, and are not in scope for /r/WoWMarket either.

###### Guild Master (GM) Jokes
Some are funny, but a vast majority have been heard and posted a million times before. 

###### Where do I get cheap game time?
World of Warcraft is a subscription-based game, and has a monthly fee attached. If you spot a great deal for reduced game time, by all means post it, but please don't solicit places to purchase it cheaply. Alternatively, look into spending in-game gold on WoW Tokens.

###### "I'm Quitting WoW"
We're sorry to see you go, but you don't need to announce it to us. If you're getting bored with the game, why not re-roll on another faction as another class and give the game another shot?

###### Live Streams
Regardless of medium (YouTube, Twitch, etc.), live streams are out of scope for this community. Try your luck in /r/wowstreams!

###### Long Lost Buddy Posts
The chances of you finding Blàzéít from your guild back in [AQ40](http://www.wowhead.com/temple-of-ahnqiraj) probably aren't the best on here. If you really want to try your luck, give /r/LongLostGamers a shot. Blàzéít is probably looking for you, too!
