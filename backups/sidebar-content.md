#Rules and Guidelines

* **This is not a place to sell/trade/buy gold or accounts, or advertise private servers.**  
* **Please post [scroll requests](/r/wowscrolls#noicon), [friend recruitment](/r/wowraf#noicon) and [LFG listings](/r/lookingforgroup#noicon) in their relevant subreddits.**

* No GM Jokes.
* No "I'm quitting WoW" posts

* Blur out names of players, where appropriate, to keep them anonymous.  Do not post personal information.  This is not a forum to call out specific players.  
* Do a search before you post a new topic to make sure it hasn’t already been submitted.
* There's lots of stuff going on in screenshots! Highlight points of interest so we know what to look at.
